## Overview

This project contains scripts to import CSV files provided by various credit cards/financial institutions into a standardized CSV format with the following headers and example output:

Date|Vendor|Category|Amount|Payment Method
---|---|---|---|---
Friday, January 03, 2020|In N Out Burger|Dining/Fast Food|$5.23|Uber Barclaycard
Monday, January 06, 2020|Safeway|Grocery|$32.46|Citi DoubleCash

## Cards Supported
* Barclaycard Uber Rewards
* Capital One Quicksilver
* Chase Amazon Rewards
* Citi DoubleCash
* Discover It

Note that other cards from the same banks likely follow a similar standard output format. When asked by the financial institution to choose a format, always use the CSV or Excel option.

## Code Style

This is largely simple, script-based code. There is a good amount of repeated code and documented as well as undocumented TODOs.

It is written against python3.6. There is no requirements file as there are no imports needed.
